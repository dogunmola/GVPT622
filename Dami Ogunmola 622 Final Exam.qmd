## Conceptual Questions

Please include all work (and computations) necessary to answer the questions.

**Total points: 20 (2 points each)**

### Question 1

Suppose you estimate a bivariate regression model with a total sample size of 50 and obtain a standard error for $\beta_1$ of 2.50. What is the smallest regression coefficient ($\beta_1$) that you could have and still be able to reject the null hypothesis (of no relationship between $X_1$ and $Y$) at the 0.05 level with a one-tailed test?

df = 50 - 1 - 1 = 48 \| t = 1.677

t = $\frac{\beta_1}{SE\beta_1}$

1.677 = $\frac{\beta_1}{2.50}$

(2.50)1.677 = $\frac{\beta_1}{2.50}$ (2.50)

4.1925 = $\beta_1$

The smallest regression coefficient ($\beta_1$) that you could have and still be able to reject the null hypothesis (of no relationship between $X_1$ and $Y$) at the 0.05 level with a one-tailed test is 4.1925.

### Question 2

I regress $Y$ on $X_1$ (i.e., $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1$) and find that $\beta_1 = 4.20$, $SE_{\beta_1} = 1.90$, $t = 2.21$, $p = 0.01$, and a 95% confidence interval is \[0.48, 7.92\]. What is my best estimate of the effect of a two-unit change in $X_1$ on the mean of $Y$ in the population?

The best estimate of the effect of a two-unit change in $X_1$ on the mean of $Y$ in the population is 4.20\*2 or 8.40.

### Question 3

I conduct an OLS regression with a sample size of 90 and 5 independent variables. To determine a p-value for each coefficient, I would examine a t-distribution with how many degrees of freedom?

df = n-k-1 = 90 - 5 - 1 = 84

To determine a p-value for each coefficient, you would examine a t-distribution with 84 degrees of freedom.

### Question 4

Suppose I regress $Y$ on $X$ and compute the mean response for $Y$ at some specified value of $X$. When determining the confidence interval around this mean response, which of the following will **NOT** have any effect on the width (or size) of that confidence interval?

A.  Total sample size,

B.  Mean-squared error,

C.  [**The specified value of** $X$**,**]{.underline}

D.  None of the above: all of these (above) will affect the confidence interval,

E.  There is not enough information to answer this question.

### Question 5

I regress $Y$ on $X$ and find that $\beta_1$ has a two-tailed p-value of 0.04. Which of the following statements is most accurate?

A.  The lower and upper bound of a 95% confidence interval around $\beta_1$ will have the same sign,

B.  The absolute value for the t-statistic for $\beta_1$ will be greater than 1.96,

C.  A 90% confidence interval around $\beta_1$ will not contain zero,

D.  [**All of the above,**]{.underline}

E.  None of the above and/or there is not enough information.

### Question 6

I regress $Y$ on three independent variables -- $X_1$, $X_2$, and $X_3$ -- and I find the following 95% confidence intervals -- $\beta_1$: \[0.12, 1.45\], $\beta_2$: \[-0.01, 0.15\], and $\beta_3$: \[-0.64, -0.01\]. Which of the following statements is most accurate?

A.  $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$ will have negative coefficients, and $\beta_1$ is statistically significant at the 0.05 level (two-tailed),

B.  $\beta_1$ will have a positive coefficient, and $\beta_1$ is the only statistically significant coefficient (of the three coefficients) at the 0.05 level (two-tailed),

C.  $\beta_1$ will have a positive coefficient, $\beta_2$ and $\beta_3$ will have negative coefficients, and only $\beta_1$ and $\beta_3$ are statistically significant at the 0.05 level (two-tailed),

D.  All of the above,

E.  [**None of the above and/or there is not enough information.**]{.underline}

### Question 7

Suppose I estimate a regression with two independent variables and obtain a $R^2$ of 0.40 where the Residual Sum of Squares is equal to 5,150. What does the Total Sum of Squares equal in this regression model?

$R^2$ = $\frac{ESS}{TSS}$ | $R^2$ = 0.40

0.40 = $\frac{ESS}{TSS}$

TSS = ESS + RSS \| RSS = 5,150

TSS = ESS + 5,150

0.40 = $\frac{ESS}{ESS + 5,150}$

(ESS + 5,150)0.40 = $\frac{ESS}{ESS + 5,150}$(ESS + 5,150)

(ESS + 5,150)0.40 = ESS

0.4ESS + 2,060 = ESS

2,060 = 1ESS - 0.4ESS

2,060 = 0.6ESS

$\frac{2,060}{0.6}$ = $\frac{0.6ESS}{0.6}$

3,433.333333 = ESS

TSS = 3,433.333333 + 5,150 = 8,583.333333

Checking Work

$R^2$ = $\frac{ESS}{TSS}$ | $\frac{3,433.333333}{8,583.333333}$ = 0.40

The Total Sum of Squares in this regression model is equal to 8,583.33.

### Question 8

I regress $Y$ on $X_1$ and $X_2$ (i.e., $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2$). I find that $\beta_1 = -0.87$ with a two-tailed p value of 0.001 and $\beta_2 = 3.52$ with a two-tailed p-value of 0.04. Which of the following statements is most accurate?

A.  [$X_2$ **has a larger substantive effect on** $Y$ **than** $X_1$**, but the effect of** $X_1$ **is more statistically significant,**]{.underline}

B.  $X_1$ has a larger substantive effect on $Y$ than $X_2$ and $X_1$ is more statistically significant than $X_2$,

C.  $X_1$ has a larger substantive effect on $Y$ than $X_2$, but the effect of $X_2$ is more statistically significant,

D.  None of the above and/or there is not enough information.

### Question 9

I regress $Y$ on $X_1$ (i.e., $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1$) and obtain a $R^2$ of 0.45. Then, I regress $Y$ on both $X_1$ and $X_2$ (i.e., $Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2$) and obtain a $R^2$ of 0.53. Which of the following statements must be true?

A.  The correlation between $X_1$ and $Y$ is stronger than the correlation between $X_2$ and $Y$,

B.  The coefficient on $\beta_1$ is statistically significant in both models,

C.  [**The model with** $X_1$ **and** $X_2$ **explains more of the variation in** $Y$ **than a model with just** $X_1$**,**]{.underline}

D.  All of the above: all of these statements are true.

### Question 10

Based on the following regression equation, might the negative coefficient on the South variable be the result of southern states having a lower proportion of high school graduates than non-southern states? In no more than one sentence, explain your answer.

$$
Turnout = 34 + 0.5(Percent\ High\ School\ Graduates) â€“ 5.9(South)
$$

Based on the following regression equation, the negative coefficient on the South variable could potentially be the result of southern states having a lower proportion of high school graduates than non-southern states, suggesting there may be a relationship between the two variables.

## Applied Questions

All datasets referenced below are posted on the ELMs course site.

### Question 1

*Points: 15*

Use the `world` dataset to answer the following questions. The relevant variables and their coding information are as follows: `literacy` indicates a country's literacy rate; `dem_score14` represents a country's level of democratization (higher values indicate greater democratization); `spendeduc` reflects the amount of public expenditures on education as a percentage of GDP; `gdp_10_thou` represents GDP per capita (one unit is \$10,000 USD); `educ_quality` indicates the average quality rating of a country's educational system; and `ungr9095` represents the percent average annual population growth.

#### Part A

*Points: 4*

Evaluate the bivariate relationship (using R) between a country's support for public education and its literacy rate. Report the results in a professionally formatted table. Do countries that spend more money on education appear to have a higher literacy rate?

```{r}
ggplot(data = world, mapping = aes(x = spendeduc, y = literacy)) +
    geom_point() +
    labs(x = "Public Expenditures on Education",
         y = "Literacy Rate") +
    theme_minimal()
```

```{r}
literacy.model <- lm(literacy ~ spendeduc, data = world)
summary(literacy.model)
```

```{r}
modelsummary(literacy.model,
             coef_rename = c(
                 spendeduc = "Public Expenditures on Education (% GDP)"),
             statistic = c("t = {statistic}",
                           "SE = {std.error}", "conf.int", "p.value"))
```

A one percentage point increase in the amount of public expenditures on education as a percentage of GDP is associated with 1.7220 percentage point increase in a country's literacy rate on average, seemingly suggesting that countries that spend more on education appear to have a higher literacy rate on average. However, this is not statistically significant as the p-value, 0.0505, is greater than 0.05. Furthermore, the confidence interval around the coefficient includes a negative sign, indicating that zero is a possible value and thus, that one cannot reject the null hypothesis.

Despite the positive regression coefficient for education expenditures, the scatterplot displays that countries that spend more on education (as a percentage of their GDP) do not appear to have higher literacy rates as there are some countries that have lower levels of public expenditures (as a percentage of their GDP) on education and still have higher literacy rates than countries with greater expenditures.

Ultimately, based on the results from the regression output, there is not a enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis of no effect. Thus, one cannot conclude that countries that spend more money on education have a higher literacy rate.

#### Part B

*Points: 5*

Estimate a second regression model (using R) that includes both a country's public expenditures on education and its level of democratization as independent variables. When controlling for democratization, does education expenditures exhibit a significant impact on literacy? Report the results in a professionally formatted table. Be sure to discuss the extent to which the results change, and if so, why they changed.

```{r}
literacy.model2 <- lm(literacy ~ spendeduc + dem_score14, data = world)
summary(literacy.model2)
```

```{r}
modelsummary(literacy.model2, 
             coef_rename = c(spendeduc = "Public Expenditures on Education (% GDP)", dem_score14 = "Level of Democratization"),
             statistic = c("t = {statistic}", "SE = {std.error}", "conf.int", "p.value"))
```

When controlling for democratization, education expenditures does not exhibit a significant impact on literacy. In fact, the p-value associated with education expenditures increased from 0.0505 to 0.748.

Furthermore, the education expenditures coefficient changed, decreasing from 1.7220 to 0.2582. Thus, rather than a one percentage point increase in the amount of public expenditures on education as a percentage of GDP being associated with 1.7220 percentage point increase in the country's literacy rate on average (when not controlling for democratization), a one percentage point increase in the amount of public expenditures on education as a percentage of GDP is associated with a 0.2582 increase in literacy rate on average when controlling for democratization.

The education expenditure coefficient likely decreased as in the first model did not include the level of democratization variable which better accounts for the true relationship observed. Thus, once the level of democratization variable was included in the model, the magnitude on the education expenditures variable significantly decreased and the p-value increased.

Furthermore, holding all else constant, a one-unit increase in level of democratization is associated with a 4.6504 percentage point increase in literacy rate, on average. This is statistically significant as the p-value is less than 0.05.

#### Part C

*Points: 6*

Now estimate a third model (using R) that includes all of the variables listed above. Report the regression results in a professionally formatted table and interpret each coefficient. When interpreting the impact of democratization using this regression model, present/utilize a visual representation (using R) of the expected change in literacy as a function of democratization.

```{r}
world$log_gdp_10_thou <- log(world$gdp_10_thou)
literacy.model3 <- lm(literacy ~ spendeduc + dem_score14 + log_gdp_10_thou + educ_quality + ungr9095, data = world)
summary(literacy.model3)
```

```{r}
modelsummary(literacy.model3, 
             coef_rename = c(
                 spendeduc = "Public Expenditures on Education (% GDP)",
                 dem_score14 = "Level of Democratization",
                 log_gdp_10_thou = "GDP per Capita (logged)",
                 educ_quality = "Country's Educational System Average Quality Rating",
                 ungr9095 = "Percent Average Annual Population Growth"),
             statistic = c("t = {statistic}", "SE = {std.error}", "conf.int", "p.value"))
```

```{r}
plot_predictions(literacy.model3, condition = "dem_score14") +
    labs(x = "Level of Democratization",
         y = "Literacy Rate")
```

Holding all else constant, a one percentage point increase in education expenditures as a percentage of GDP is associated with a 0.3923 percentage point increase in a country's literacy rate on average. This is not statistically significant as the p-value (0.633464) is greater than 0.05.

Holding all else constant, a one-unit increase in level of democratization is associated with a 0.8251 percentage point increase in a country's literacy rate on average. This is not statistically significant as the p-value (0.328220) is greater than 0.05.

Holding all else constant, a one-unit increase in logged GDP per capita is associated with a 6.3608 percentage point increase in a country's literacy rate on average. This is statistically significant as the p-value is less than 0.05.

Holding all else constant, a one-point increase in the average quality rating of a country's education system is associated with a 0.6077 percentage point increase in literacy rates on average. This is not statistically significant as the p-value (0.741839) is greater than 0.05.

Holding all else constant, a one percentage point increase in the percent average annual population growth is associated with a 3.0221 percentage point decrease in a country's literacy rate on average. This is statistcally significant as the p-value (0.000476) is less than 0.05.

### Question 2

*Points: 15*

Using the `states` dataset, use R to regress the variable `obama08` (the percentage of a state's vote that President Obama received in the 2008 U.S. presidential election) on the following independent variables: `cig_tax` represents the amount of a state's cigarette tax (in dollars); `college` is the percentage of a state's population that graduated college (0 to 100); `union07` is the percentage of a state's workers that are union members (0 to 100); and `south` is a dichotomous variable coded as `1` if the state is located in the South (`0` otherwise). Report the results in a professionally formatted table. Answer the following questions.

```{r}
obama08.model <- lm(obama08 ~ cig_tax + college + union07 + south, data = states)
summary(obama08.model)
```

```{r}
modelsummary(obama08.model, 
             coef_rename = c(
                 cig_tax = "State's Cigarette Tax (in dollars)",
                 college = "Percentage of State's Population that Graduated College",
                 union07 = "Percentage of State's Workers that are Union Members",
                 south = "Southern State"),
             statistic = c("t = {statistic}", "SE = {std.error}", "conf.int", "p.value"))
```

#### Part A

*Points: 6*

Interpret the substantive results from this regression model. Be sure to discuss the direction, magnitude, and statistical significance of each slope coefficient. Does the `union07` variable exhibit a substantively significant impact on voting behavior in the 2008 election?

Holding all else constant, a one dollar increase in a state's tax on cigarettes is associated with a 0.5230 percentage point increase in the percentage of a state's vote that President Obama received in the 2008 Presidential election on average. This is not statistically significant as the p-value (0.815676) is greater than 0.05. Furthermore, the confidence interval around the coefficient contains zero. Thus, one cannot reject the null hypothesis that the amount of a state's tax on cigarettes has no effect on the percentage of a state's vote that President Obama received in the 2008 Presidential election.

Holding all else constant, a one percentage point increase in the percentage of a state's population that graduated from college was associated with a 0.9646 percentage point increase in the percentage of a state's vote that President Obama received in the 2008 Presidential election on average. This is statistically significant as the p-value (0.000299) is less than 0.05, suggesting states with a greater proportion of college graduates tended to vote for Obama in the 2008 presidential election at higher rates on average. Yet, the magnitude of the coefficient is rather small; thus though the results are statistically significant, the results are not substantively significant.

Holding all else constant, a one percentage point increase in the percentage of a state's workers that are union members is associated with a 0.7514 percentage point increase in the percentage of a state's vote that President Obama received in the 2008 Presidential election on average. This is statistically significant as the p-value (0.003511) is less than 0.05. However, the magnitude of the coefficient is relatively small; thus, the union07 variable does not exhibit a substantively significant impact on voting behavior in the 2008 presidential election.

Holding all else constant, southern states were associated with a 1.3928 percentage point increase in the percentage of a state's vote that President Obama received in the 2008 Presidential election than non-southern states on average. This is not statistically significant as the p-value (0.593179) is greater than 0.05.

#### Part B

*Points: 2*

Interpret the intercept coefficient. What does this represent and is it meaningful to interpret this coefficient on its own? Why or why not?

The intercept represents the value of Y, the dependent variable, if all the independent variables were equal to 0. Thus, in this case, the intercept represents the percentage of the vote Obama would be expected to receive in a state in the 2008 presidential election if a state did not have a tax on cigarettes, did not have any college graduates, did not have any union members, and was not in the south.

The interpret coefficient suggests that if a state did not have a tax on cigarettes, did not have any college graduates, did not have any union members, and was not in the south, Obama would be expected to receive 16.128% of the state's vote in the 2008 presidential election.

It is not meaningful to interpret the coefficient on its own as it would not be possible for 0% of a states population to have graduated from college or to be members of unions. Additionally, all of the states in the dataset have a tax on cigarettes (thus, the amount of a state's cigarette tax also cannot be equal to 0).

#### Part C

*Points: 2*

What is the expected mean percentage of Obama's vote total in a Southern state with a cigarette tax of \$2.00, a state population where 30% of people are college graduates, and where 15% of workers in a state are union members?

```{r}
obama.expectedmean <- 0.5230*2 + 0.9646*30 + 0.7514*15 + 1.3928*1
obama.expectedmean
```

The expected mean percentage of Obama's vote total in a Southern state with a cigarette tax of \$2.00, a state population where 30% of people are college graduates, and where 15% of workers in a state are union members is 42.6478%.

#### Part D

*Points: 3*

What is a 90% confidence interval around the coefficient for the `south` variable.

```{r}
tidy(obama08.model, conf.int = T, conf.level = .90)
```

![](images/Screenshot 2024-12-21 at 3.45.52 PM.png){width="174"}

df = n-k-1 = 50 - 4 - 1= 50 - 5 = 45

t = 1.679, B1 = 1.3928, SE = 2.5885

1.3928+(1.679)(2.5885) = 5.7388915

1.3928-(1.679)(2.5885) = -2.9532915

A 90% confidence interval around the coefficient for the south variable is \[-2.9532915, 5.7388915\].

#### Part E

*Points: 3*

What is the null hypothesis that the F-test in this regression output is testing?

The F-test in this regression output is testing if all of the coefficients are jointly equal to zero and thus, jointly ineffectual. As such, in this regression output, the F-test is testing if the coefficients for the variables representing the amount of a state's tax on cigarettes, the percentage of a state's population that has graduated from college, the percentage of a state's workers that are union members, and whether a state is southern are jointly equal to zero meaning that the amount of a state's tax on cigarettes, the percentage of a state's population that has graduated from college, the percentage of a state's workers that are union members, and whether a state is southern has no effect on Y, the percentage of a state's vote that President Obama received in the 2008 U.S. presidential election.
