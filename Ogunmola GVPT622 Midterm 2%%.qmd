### Question 1

*2 points*

::: callout-note
2/2
:::

**Suppose I am interested in determining if freshman undergraduates at the University of Maryland spend more hours studying in the average week than sophomore undergraduates. I conduct a study in which I take a simple random sample (SRS) of 1200 freshman students and 1200 sophomore students. I find that the freshman students in my sample study for, on average, 412 minutes per week and the sophomore students in my sample study for, on average, 335 minutes per week. The standard error of the difference is 30. What is a 90% confidence interval for the difference between freshman and sophomore students?**

90% confidence interval z= 1.645

$\left(412-335\right)+1.645\left(30\right)$ = 126.35

$\left(412-335\right)-1.645\left(30\right)$ = 27.65

The 90% confidence interval for the difference between freshman and sophomore students is \[27.65, 126.35\].

### Question 2

*2 points*

::: callout-note
2/2
:::

**Based on the results of my study described in question 1, can you reject the null hypothesis of no statistically meaningful difference in the study habits of sophomore and freshman students? Why or why not?**

![](images/Screenshot%202024-11-03%20at%207.53.25%20PM.png)

t = $\frac{\left(412-335\right)}{30}$ = 2.566666667

.9948 \| 1-.9948=.0052

Based on the results of the study, you can the reject the null hypothesis of no statistically meaningful difference in the study habits of sophomore and freshman students because the p-value is less than 0.05. Specifically, the p-value associated with the test statistic (2.56) is .0052 suggests that there is a .52% chance that you would have pulled such a sample from the population if the null hypothesis were true.

### Question 3

*2 points*

::: callout-note
2/2
:::

**If I am testing a null hypothesis that X has no effect on Y in the population (and thus my alternative hypothesis is that X does have an effect), why might I prefer to commit a Type-II error over a Type-I error (and, of course, this holds aside my first preference of making no error at all)? Answer in no more than two sentences.**

If testing a null hypothesis, you might prefer to commit a Type-II error over a Type-I error, as committing a Type-I error, or stating that there is a relationship between variables based on the sample when in actuality there is no relationship in the population has the potential to mislead research. Conversely, in academia, researchers would prefer to commit a Type-II error and say that based on a sample, there is no relationship even if in actuality in the population there is a relationship between variables as even if a relationship exists in the population such a relationship could be hard to find and parse out for a multitude of reasons such as difficulty of gathering data or forming a large enough sample size.

### Question 4

*1 point*

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

**When conducting a difference-of-means test, which of the following samples would yield a sampling distribution with the lowest variability?**

A.  [**A sample of 900 with a standard deviation of 15**]{.underline}
B.  A sample of 25 with a standard deviation of 10
C.  A sample of 625 with a standard deviation of 20
D.  A sample of 100 with a standard deviation of 6

### Question 5

*1 point*

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

**Which of the following probabilities is not independent?**

A.  The probability that the roulette wheel will end up on 23 two times in a row.
B.  The probability that three successive coin tosses will each turn up heads.
C.  [**The probability that I draw an ace and then a king in a row from a deck of cards (when drawing a two-card hand).**]{.underline}
D.  The probability that I will get a 6 on three subsequent die rolls.
E.  None of the above – all are independent probabilities.

### Question 6

*1 point*

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

**I conduct a two-tailed difference-of-means test and obtain a t-statistic of 2.10. Is my result statistically significant (with 95% confidence)?**

\[p = 0.9821\] or .0179 (1-0.9821) \| .0179\*2 = 0.0358

A.  [**Yes, at the 0.05 level (p\<0.05)**]{.underline}
B.  Yes, but only at the 0.10 level (p\<0.10)
C.  Not at either the 0.05 or the 0.10 level
D.  There is not enough information to answer this question.

### Question 7

*1 point*

::: callout-note
1/1
:::

**I take a sample of 1800 adults and find that 360 of them watched last Monday’s NFL game. What probability represents the complement to the sample proportion of adults who watched the NFL game?**

P(Complement)=1-P(A)

P(A) = 360/1800 = 0.2

Complement = 1-(360/1800) = .8

The probability, 0.8 or 80%, represents the complement to the sample proportion of adults who watched the NFL game.

### Question 8

*1 point*

::: callout-note
0/1, E
:::

**Which of the following makes it more likely that a given sample statistic will be statistically different from zero (and thus allow you to reject the null hypothesis, all else equal)?**

A.  [**More observations**]{.underline}
B.  Greater variance in the sample
C.  Using a two-tailed instead of a one-tailed significance test
D.  A larger confidence interval around the test statistic
E.  Both (a) and (b) (but not (c) or (d))
F.  All of the above increase the chances of statistical significance
G.  None of the above

### Question 9

*1 point*

::: callout-note
0/1, A.
:::

**The p-value for a two-tailed test of the null hypothesis** $H_0: \mu=40$ **is 0.06. Which of the following statements is accurate?**

A.  A 95% confidence interval around the sample mean includes the value 40
B.  [**A 90% confidence interval around the sample mean includes the value 40**]{.underline}
C.  A 99% confidence interval around the sample mean does not include the value 40
D.  None of the above statements are correct
E.  All of the above statements are correct

### Question 10

0.5/2
:::

**If you roll a fair (six-sided) die twice, what is the probability that both rolls will be odd or greater than four?**

P(A & B)=P(A)\*P(B)

\[1,2,3,4,5,6\]

P(A) = odd (1,3,5) or \>4 (5,6) \[1,3,5,6\] = 4/6

P(B) = odd (1,3,5) or \>4 (5,6) \[1,3,5,6\] = 4/6

$\frac{4}{6}*\frac{4}{6}$ = 0.4444444444

If you roll a fair six-sided die twice, the probability that both rolls will be odd or greater than four is 0.4444 or 44.44%.

The following is a distribution of U.S. college students classified by their age and full- vs. part-time status. Based on these data, what is the probability that a student is in the 25-29 age group, given that (i.e., conditional on knowledge that) the student is full time?

```{r}
tibble::tibble(
  age = c("15 - 19", "20 - 24", "25 - 29", "30+"),
  full_time = c(155, 255, 75, 35),
  part_time = c(20, 55, 80, 95)
) |> 
  knitr::kable()
```

155+255+75+35=520

155+255+75+35+20+55+80+95=770

P(A\|B)=P(A and B)/P(B)

P(A and B)= probability 25-29 and full time = 75/770 = 0.0974025974

P(B) = probability full time = $\frac{520}{770}$ = 0.6753246753

$\frac{0.0974025974}{0.6753246753}$ = 0.1442307692

The probability that a student is in the 25-29 age group, given that (i.e., conditional on knowledge that) the student is full time is 0.1442307692 or 14.423%.

Using a SRS of 1211 people, I estimate that the proportion of people living in the South that favor teaching sexual education in public schools is 0.874 and the proportion of people outside of the south that favor teaching sexual education in public schools is 0.906. And, the standard error of the difference (in citizen views about teaching sexual education in public schools) between people living in the south and those not living in the south is 0.015. Give an interval estimate for the difference in the proportion of people favoring sex education in public schools between people who do, and do not, live in the south.

![](images/Screenshot%202024-11-06%20at%209.43.34%20PM.png){width="70" height="21"}

D = .906-.874 = 0.032

$\left(.906-.874\right)+2.133333333\cdot\sqrt{\frac{.906\left(1-.906\right)}{1211}+\frac{.874\left(1-.874\right)}{1211}}$ = 0.05909096196

$\left(.906-.874\right)-2.133333333\cdot\sqrt{\frac{.906\left(1-.906\right)}{1211}+\frac{.874\left(1-.874\right)}{1211}}$ = 0.004909038039

::: callout-note

:::

An interval estimate for the difference in the proportion of people favoring sex education in public schools between people who do, and do not, live in the south is \[0.004909038039, 0.05909096196\].

**I am interested in estimating the average number of texts that University of Maryland undergraduate students send in a day. My hypothesis is that the average number of texts students send is greater than 100.

What is a 95% confidence interval around the sample statistic?

95% confidence interval equation = $\bar{x} \pm z \cdot (s\div \sqrt{n})$

$$
\bar{x} = 105,
n = 1600,
s = 120,
z = 1.96
$$

$$
105+1.96\left(\frac{120}{\sqrt{1600}}\right) = 110.88
$$

$$
105+1.96\left(\frac{120}{\sqrt{1600}}\right) = 99.12
$$

The 95% confidence interval around that estimate is (99.12, 110.88).

#### Part B

:::

**When testing the null hypothesis, what is the test statistic associated with the sample statistic?**

$\frac{\left(105-100\right)}{\frac{120}{\sqrt{1600}}}$ = 1.666666667

When testing the null hypothesis, the test statistic associated with the sample statistic is 1.666666667.

**If using a one-tailed test of the null hypothesis and you are willing to accept a Type-I error rate of 0.05, do the data support my hypothesis? Why or why not?**

If using a one-tailed test of the null hypothesis and you are willing to accept a Type-I error rate of 0.05, the data does support your hypothesis because the p-value is less than 0.05. Specifically, the p-value associated with the above test statistic is .0475.

**Total points: 24**

### Question 1

*8 points total*

I hypothesize that, among only those that were eligible to vote, people with greater confidence in the U.S. military were more likely to turnout to vote in the 2008 presidential election. Use data from the General Social Survey (i.e., the `gss` dataset) to test my hypothesis (the unit of analysis is the individual survey respondent). Specifically, use the following variables: `conarmy` (1 = a “great deal” of confidence; 2 = “only some” confidence; 3 = “hardly any”); and `vote08` (1 = did not vote; 2 = voted). Answer the following questions.

#### Part A

Complete a cross-tab and interpret the results. Do the data support my hypothesis? Be sure to explain the nature of the relationship (or lack thereof, if relevant).

```{r}
gss <- gss |>
    mutate(conarmy = factor(conarmy,
                            levels = c("A GREAT DEAL", "ONLY SOME", "HARDLY ANY")),
           voted08 = factor(voted08, levels = c("Did not vote", "Voted")))
datasummary_crosstab(voted08 ~ conarmy,
                     statistic = 1 ~ 1 + N + Percent ("col"),
                     data = gss)
```

The data does support your hypothesis. In the 2008 presidential election, those with greater confidence in the military made up a greater share of the proportion of those who voted compared to those who did not have high confidence in the military. Specifically, 68.5% of those with a great deal of confidence in the military voted, compared to 55.0% of who had hardly any confidence in the military who voted.

Similarly, those with lower levels of confidence in the military make up a greater proportion of those who did not vote in the 2008 election. Specifically, 32.1% of those with hardly any confidence in the military did not vote compared to 23.8% of those with a great deal of confidence in the military who did not vote in the 2008 presidential election. However, the relationship is not perfect as 22.4% of those with only some confidence in the military did not vote, a smaller proportion than those with a great deal or more confidence in the military who did not vote.

**Using the chi-square statistic that you computed in question 1(b), can you reject the null hypothesis of no relationship between these two variables with 95% confidence? Why, or why not?**

Using the chi-square statistic that I computed in question 1(b), I can reject the null hypothesis of no relationship of no relationship between these two variables with 95% confidence because the p-value associated with the chi-square statistic (11.55303) is less than 0.05, the commonly-used metric for social science research. Specifically, the p-value is 0.003099498. Thus, that means that there is a 0.30994% chance that one would have pulled a sample from the population with the differences present between the two groups if the null hypothesis were true.

### Question 2

**I hypothesize that citizens who do not support fracking are less conservative than those who do support fracking. Use data from the `nes` dataset to test my hypothesis (the unit of analysis is the individual survey respondent). Specifically, use the following variables: `fracking` (1 = “approve” of fracking; 2 = “middle”; 3 = “disapprove”); and `libcon7` (higher values represent less liberalism, or more conservatism). Answer the following questions.**

datasummary_crosstab(envir_drill ~ pid_x, data = nes, 
                     statistic = 1 ~ 1 + N + Percent("col"))
```

The data does support your hypothesis that citizens who do not support fracking are less conservative than those who do support fracking. Specfically, 84% of those who identify as strongly Republican are in favor of fracking compared to only 39% of strong Democrats.

Furthermore, 24.8% of strong Democrats oppose fracking compared to 5.4% of strong Republicans. Lastly, conservatives were less likely to respond that they neither favor nor oppose fracking compared to strong democrats and independents.

The difference in the mean approval and disapproval of fracking between conservatives and liberals is statistically significant as the p-value associated with the chi-square statistic of 907.7343 is less than 1.253933e-186. Thus, that means that there is a close to 0% chance that one would have pulled a sample that demonstrated a difference in support for fracking based on party identification if the null hypothesis were true. Thus, one can reject the null hypothesis.

```{r}
obs_values <- count(nes, envir_drill, pid_x, name = "obs_n")

**I hypothesize that people who express that religion is important to them were more likely to turnout to vote in the 2008 presidential election. Use data from the `nes` dataset to test my hypothesis (the unit of analysis is the individual survey respondent). Specifically, use the following variables: `relig_pray`, which describes how often the respondent prays (1 = several times a day; 2 = once a day; 3 = a few times a week; 4 = once a week or less; 5 = never); and `voted2008` (1 = did not vote; 2= voted).

The point estimate for the proportion of respondents that voted (i.e., turnout rate), among citizens expressing that religion is not important is 70.10. The point estimate for the proportion of respondents that voted, among citizens expressing that religion matters a great deal is 80.14.

datasummary_crosstab(voted2008 ~ relig_pray, data = nes, 
                     statistic = 1 ~ 1 + N + Percent("col"))
```

Though, overall, the majority of respondents voted, there is a difference between the proportion of voters who voted who expressed religion is not important vs those reporting religion matters a great deal. Specifically, 82.1% of those pray several times a day voted compared to 71.9% of those who never pray. Furthermore, 17.5% of those who pray several times a day did not vote compared to %27.4% of those who never pray.

The difference in the mean turnout among those who expressed different views on the importance of religion is statistically significant as the p-value is less than 0.05. Specifically, the chi-square statistic (41.959) is associated with a p-value less than 1.701e-08. This means that there is a close to 0% chance that one would have pulled such a sample with different levels of turnout based on the importance of religion in their lives if the null hypothesis were true. Thus, one can reject the null hypothesis.
